A Windows app for movie lovers, those who watch movies in the darkness of night and give pain to their eyes.
This screen filter will simply reduce the glossyness of the screen but you have to compromise a bit with picture quality, ovbiously.
This is my first PyQt5 app, the most basic one with a single window and a combo box.

Ya! I know that this is very basic app, but as mentioned this is my first test app so all done for fun :D and it actually works if
you compromise with picture quality a bit, which I guess is with any other filter that you choose.

To use it, first of all open the app minimized, lauch your movie and than pull the filter to maximized mode. You can control the 
visibility allowance by changing the combo box values either by click or by up/down arrow keys.

PS: Any suggestions on how to send the input events on the background window can improve the flexibility and are highly welcomed!
